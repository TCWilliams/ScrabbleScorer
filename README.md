# ScrabbleScorer
Android app to keep Scrabble scores

A simple app I made because my flatmates were using all the paper and losing all the pens.

It is a simple application consisting of 5 activities. 
Activity 
  1) select number of players
  
  2) enter names
  
  3) keep scores during game, displays total scores and on ongoing list of scores for each player
     
     highlights current player name and score
     
     has row of buttons to go to an online dictionary, undo preivous scores, finish game (with confirmation dialog)
     
     also has a feature where if the phone is shaken, simulates the board being shaken in anger and kills the game
  
  4) results page - displays results
  
     go back to view game scores (with changes to the scoring activity so that scores can not be altered, 
     and button row replaced by go back to results button
  
  5) board shake activity - game killed when device is shaken during play. 
    Displays a message yet to be decided. Should be crude but not too crude.
  
  TODO: I want to add a web component to keep track of games over time
